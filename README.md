👍🏻 Due to the significant attention my post received on /c12 <a href=”https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1au0bw0/blurfox/”>Reddit</a>, I wanted to celebrate this by creating a GitHub page. I am grateful for your interest, but I am new to CSS, and with your help, I aim to create a flawless experience
